# Themes

**Probabalistic Guarantees**
Most core cryptographic primitives such as RSA or AES relie on probabalistic guarantees for security. How might propabalistic guarantees be enforced in smart contracts to achieve desirable properties?

**Identity Systems**
Recent advances in crypto mean that anyone can become their own certificate authority and issue ids with better security than state ids. How might smart contracts / blockchain facilitate new identity systems?c

**Political Action DAO**
Novel mechanisms for coordinated activism are now possible on the blockchain. How might a smart contract / blockchain aided political action commitee might look?

Possible ideas
- multiparty political oracle
- voting
- reputation systems/"web of trust"
- futarchy
- smart contract dao
